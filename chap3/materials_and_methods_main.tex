\chapter{Materials \& Methods}

\textbf{This section should include a recipe of what you did (explain what you have done so if someone wants to reproduce the experiment, they can).  A flow chart is typically helpful.  Also, make sure to define all software that you used including version numbers and OS.  Should also include a description of statistical methods used (if any).\footnote{For more information see: \url{http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/49/10/1229.short}}}

\section{An Example of an Equation}

The following is the most beuatiful equation in maths, Euler's Identity (Equation~\ref{eq:euleridentity}).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:euleridentity}
	e^{i\pi}+1=0
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{conditionsenv*}
	e 		& the constant \\
	i 		& of complex fame \\
	\pi		& not of the apple variety \\
\end{conditionsenv*}
