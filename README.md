# University of Malta -- LaTeX Dissertation Template

A modern, highly configurable assignment/project/fyp/dissertation/thesis template for the University of Malta.  (In reality, there is nothing specific to the University of Malta, and this LaTeX class may be used anywhere).  This template is loosely based on my D.Phil. Thesis at the University of Oxford, which was loosely based on ...  You get the drift.

This template was clearly needed, as I keep correcting/examining poorly and inconsistently formatted dissertations all the time.  Updates to the template with examples (2-page landscape table anyone?) are greatly appreciated -- either through pull requestsi, github issues or emails (jean.p.ebejer@um.edu.mt). 

I am also keen on keeping an FAQ with the most common LaTeX problems, which you are bound to face on the night before your submission deadline.

## FAQ

### What is the difference (if any) between a thesis and a dissertation?

> University of Malta regulations specify a thesis only in case of PhD, and SThD degrees.  In all other cases it is a dissertation.

Bet you didn't know this one bit of academic trivia!  (Note: The answer is specific to the University of Malta, answer given by our dear registrar, Ms Veronica Grech).
